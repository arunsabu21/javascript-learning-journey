// JavaScript Array toString()
// The toString() method returns the elements of an array as a comma separated string.
const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
let myList = fruits.toString();
console.log(myList);

// Every JavaScript object has a toString() method.
// The toString() method is used internally by JavaScript when an object needs to be displayed as a text (like in HTML), or when an object needs to be used as a string.
