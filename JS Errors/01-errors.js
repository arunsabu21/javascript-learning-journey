/*
When executing JavaScript code, different errors can occur.

Errors can be coding errors made by the programmer, errors due to wrong input, and other unforeseeable things:

Reference Errors
Type Errors
Range Errors
URI Errors
Syntax Errors
Eval Error (deprecated)
Silent Errors


How to Handle JavaScript Errors
The try statement allows you to define a block of code to be tested for errors while it is being executed.

The catch statement allows you to define a block of code to be executed, if an error occurs in the try block.

The JavaScript statements try and catch come in pairs:

try {
  Block of code to try
} catch(err) {
  Block of code to handle errors
}
