/*
JavaScript Error Statements
The try Statement
In JavaScript, the try statement is used to handle errors (also called exceptions) that may occur during code execution - without stopping the entire program.

The try statement works together with catch.

Sometimes it works with finally.

And sometimes it works with throw.

try {
  // Code that may cause an error
} catch (error) {
  // Code to handle the error
} finally {
  // Code that always runs, no matter what
}
