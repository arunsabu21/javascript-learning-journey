# JavaScript Learning Journey

Welcome! This repository is a complete collection of my JavaScript learning journey — from basics to advanced concepts, with real-world examples. It documents daily progress, hands-on experiments, and personal notes to help master JavaScript essentials.

Inspired by tutorials such as [W3Schools JavaScript Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/js/), the repo is organized for easy reference and practical use.
